## Hierarchical Clustering

I am running a few cpp experimentation on incorperating heuristics and parallelization into hcn.

## hclust-cpp

Included in this directory is the following repository: [https://github.com/cdalitz/hclust-cpp/](https://github.com/cdalitz/hclust-cpp/)

This repository is an adaptation of Daniel Mullner's work:

> "fastcluster: Fast Hierarchical, Agglomerative Clustering Routines for R and Python." Journal of Statistical Software 53, no. 9, pp. 1-18 (2013)

However, this version is a standalone c++ library by [cdalitz](https://github.com/cdalitz).
